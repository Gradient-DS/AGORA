## Error Checking Protocol

After making ANY changes to files, always check for errors:

1. **After editing code files**: Run `read_lints` on the modified file(s) to check for linting errors
2. **After editing C4 diagrams** (`workspace.dsl`): Run `read_lints` to validate the DSL syntax
3. **If errors are found**: Fix them immediately before proceeding
4. **Never leave broken code**: Always ensure all linting errors are resolved

This applies to all file modifications including:
- Source code files (.ts, .tsx, .js, .py, etc.)
- Configuration files (.json, .yml, .yaml)
- C4 architecture files (.dsl)
- Any other editable files in the workspace
