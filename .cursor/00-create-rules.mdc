# Cursor Rules Location

How to add new cursor rules to the project

## Rule File Location

1. Always place rule files in `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`:
   ```
   .cursor/rules/
   ├── your-rule-name.mdc
   ├── another-rule.mdc
   └── ...
   ```

2. Follow the naming convention:
   - Use kebab-case for filenames
   - Always use .mdc extension
   - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose
   - Use numeric prefixes for ordering (00-, 01-, for common rules, 10-, 20-, etc. for topic-specific rules)

3. Directory structure:
   ```
   PROJECT_ROOT/
   ├── .cursor/
   │   └── rules/
   │       ├── 00-foundation.mdc
   │       ├── 01-conventions.mdc
   │       └── 10-topic-specific.mdc
   └── ...
   ```

4. Never place rule files:
   - In the project root
   - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
   - In any other location

## Rule File Structure

Cursor rules have the following structure:

```markdown
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs: optional/path/pattern/**/* 
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule Title

Main content explaining the rule with markdown formatting.

1. Step-by-step instructions
2. Code examples
3. Guidelines

Example:
```python
# Good example
def good_example():
    # Implementation following guidelines
    pass

# Bad example
def bad_example():
    # Implementation not following guidelines
    pass
```
```

## Header Fields

- `description`: Brief explanation of what the rule does (required)
- `globs`: File patterns where this rule applies (optional, array or string)
- `alwaysApply`: Whether to include in all conversations (default: false)

## Best Practices

- Use `alwaysApply: true` for global conventions (00-, 01- prefix)
- Use specific `globs` for topic-focused rules (10-, 20- prefix)
- Keep rules concise and actionable
- Include code examples when helpful
- Version rules in git like code
